#### Chapter 4: The Temptation of Pride

It had been several weeks since David began his deeper commitment to spiritual growth. He had been praying more, studying Scripture, and seeing victories over temptation. But there was one battle he hadn’t expected: the battle against pride.

It started subtly. David had been putting in long hours at work, and his efforts had finally been noticed. His supervisor called him in for a meeting one afternoon.

“David, you’ve been doing excellent work lately,” his supervisor said. “I’ve been impressed by your contributions to the team. Keep it up, and there’s a real possibility for a promotion in the near future.”

David felt a rush of pride. It was a recognition he had been longing for, a validation of his hard work and dedication. He smiled, thanked his supervisor, and left the meeting with a newfound sense of accomplishment. But as he walked back to his desk, something began to shift inside him. The praise felt good—maybe too good. As the day went on, he couldn’t help but think about how others were now noticing his success. He began to entertain thoughts like, I must be better than everyone else here. Maybe I deserve more than just this promotion. Maybe I’m the one who can lead this team, not just follow.

The temptation of pride had crept in quietly, like a whisper that slowly grew louder. The next day, David caught himself acting differently. He began to notice his coworkers in a new light—judging their work, feeling superior to them. He found himself thinking about his achievements more than ever, and a sense of entitlement began to take root in his heart.

David didn’t recognize it at first, but the pride had begun to take hold of him. It wasn’t just the pride of success; it was a pride of comparison, a sense of superiority. The more he focused on his accomplishments, the more he started to look down on others, forgetting that his success wasn’t just about his own hard work—it was also about God’s grace and the opportunities He had provided.

That evening, David sat in his living room, trying to unwind after a long day. As he scrolled through his social media feed, he saw a post from his friend Ethan, who had recently started his own business. The post was a success story, detailing how Ethan had worked tirelessly to get his business off the ground and how it was beginning to thrive. David felt a knot tighten in his chest. Ethan is doing well, he thought, but I’ve done more. I’ve worked harder. Why is he getting recognition and not me?

At that moment, the weight of his pride became clear. It wasn’t just about receiving recognition anymore. It was about comparing himself to others, measuring his worth by what he had achieved and how others saw him. He was consumed by a need for validation and success, forgetting that it wasn’t his accomplishments that defined him—it was his identity in Christ.

David picked up his Bible and turned to Philippians 2:5-8, a passage he had memorized during his study of Scripture. He read the words slowly:

Philippians 2:5-8:
“In your relationships with one another, have the same mindset as Christ Jesus: Who, being in very nature God, did not consider equality with God something to be used to his own advantage; rather, he made himself nothing by taking the very nature of a servant, being made in human likeness. And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to death—even death on a cross!”

David was struck by the humility of Jesus. Here was the Son of God—perfect, powerful, and worthy of all honor—yet He had humbled Himself, even to the point of death on the cross. Jesus didn’t seek glory for Himself; He gave up everything to serve others. In contrast, David had been focusing on his own accomplishments, seeking praise, and comparing himself to others. He had forgotten the example of Christ’s humility.

David closed his Bible and sat quietly for a few moments. The truth hit him hard: pride was not just a temptation—it was a distraction from the purpose God had for him. His success wasn’t about him; it was about God’s provision and grace. He had been blessed with opportunities to succeed, but those blessings were meant to be used for God’s glory, not his own prideful gain.

David knelt down in prayer, humbled by the revelation. “Lord, forgive me. I’ve let pride take root in my heart. I’ve focused too much on my achievements and not enough on Your will. Help me to be humble, just like Jesus. Help me to see my success as an opportunity to serve, not to elevate myself. May I always remember that everything I have is from You, and that my worth is found in You alone.”

In that moment, David felt a weight lift off his shoulders. He knew that humility would be a constant battle, but he also knew that with God’s help, he could overcome the temptation of pride. He didn’t need to prove his worth to anyone—he already had value because he was a child of God. And as long as he kept his focus on God’s purpose, he would find true fulfillment, not in the praise of men, but in serving others and glorifying God.

The next day at work, David approached his tasks with a new mindset. Instead of focusing on how others perceived him, he focused on doing his best work for God’s glory. He encouraged his coworkers and celebrated their successes, rather than comparing himself to them. His heart was lighter, and his relationships with others improved.

David realized that humility wasn’t just about denying pride—it was about redirecting his focus. It wasn’t about shrinking back or putting himself down; it was about recognizing that all good things come from God and that his success was an opportunity to serve others, not elevate himself.

As he continued on his journey, David learned to recognize the temptation of pride whenever it arose. Instead of falling into its trap, he would remember the humility of Jesus and the power of surrender. And with each victory over pride, he grew stronger in his faith, more content with who he was in Christ, and more focused on serving others.
